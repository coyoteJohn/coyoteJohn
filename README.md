Hi, I am John Unger.

I am the CDO for Alliance Systems, a St. Louis-based product development firm, and an Instructor for Savvy Coders, an award-winning online academy providing Cyber Security, Full Stack Web Development, and Data Analytics courses.

I am interested in the data behind stories, events, and trends. I was raised to question everything and the theory that one could be a good citizen through critical reading. By engaging with the world through the practice of these two skills, I could get beyond politics, entrenched systems, and bias. Today I find it more enlightening and _possible_ to look at the underlying data myself. 

Iâ€™m currently learning AI and ML technologies based on R and Python and learning how to move from coach to instructor in my field. I look forward to participating in this endeavor as a part of several communities. 

As a recent adopter of Linux, VSCode, and Obsidian, I am finally engaging with the open-source community. I look forward to participating in those innovative, collaborative, and vibrant communities.   

Feel free to connect with me.
